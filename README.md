# Mixtape.swift
[Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/) Mixtape project from the [Learn Swift](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-swift) course

"Write a program in Mixtape.swift that holds the ultimate playlist of music in a Swift array."

I'll admit that I cheated. This is (part of) a playlist from [Bustle](https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/songs-every-badass-woman-needs-in-her-life).
